## About The Project

This project is a mini project undertaken to experiemnt and learn development using C# threading on Unity's platform. This will involve usage of simple agents and possible threading pools to remove task load on the main thread. 

However this project will not undertake development in Unity's Job system as it is unstable for the 2020.3.0f release.
